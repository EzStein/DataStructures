# Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms in C
This project is a collection of many generic data structures and sorting algorithms used throughout
computer science. Structures include trees, heaps, hashes, lists and graphs. All structures are
written in plain old C in compliance with the C89 standard with as much portability as possible.
Additionally all structures are generic meaning they handle solely void pointers. 

## Trees:
